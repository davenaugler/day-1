    <h1>Hello my name is Dave Naugler</h1>

    <h2>The Now...</h2>
    <p>A little about me is my name is Dave Naugler and I am 30 years old. I find it funny that I have 
        a big passion and drive for development because growing up I was a sports-fanatic. I was always outside
        raerly on the computer. The way our world has shifted, being the developer is like having the keys to the Kingdom
        in my opinion.</p>

    <h2>The Then...</h2>
    <p>Prior to finding my love for development I was leaving high-school and getting comfortable being a gym rat and clanking
        and banging the weights around. Building an awesome phyique was amazning to me. Learning what I needed to do to change this
        or change that abbout my body was where my interests were. This is when I entered Boise State Univiersity and started my education
        into the Kinesiology field.</p>
